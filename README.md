# Superstore Data Analysis and Classification
by [Jalal Assaly](www.github.com/Jalal-Assaly)

This project was completed as part of the Data Science elective at MSA University in the Faculty of Engineering, Computer Systems Engineering department. It aims to analyze the performance of a fictional superstore using the dataset "Global Superstore.csv" with Python and Jupyter Notebooks. The analysis addresses 20 key questions about store performance, and the project includes clustering to identify the best and worst-performing products as part of an unsupervised learning approach.
